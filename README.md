# metadata.tvshows.thesportsdb.python
Python version of the Kodi scraper for Sports events for Kodi 20 (Nexus) and later

This scraper does support parsing nfo files to identify a league even if the folder name does not match the league name.  See https://kodi.wiki/view/NFO_files/Parsing for more information on parsing nfo files.

The SportsDB TV Show scraper uses the URL for the league page as the parsing URL.  So, for instance, the parsing URL for MLS (American Major League Soccer) would be:

https://www.thesportsdb.com/league/4346-American-Major-League-Soccer

or

https://www.thesportsdb.com/league/4346
